ABOUT

This project was made for the May 2020 Epicodus Cohort in an effort to make updating and editing the ~100+ repos we have made thus far. This application allows the user to input a projects details in a simple form, and output a well-structured and aesthetically pleasing README.md without getting bogged down in markdown syntax and worrying about uniformity across your repos.

This application is a single page form that allows you to input the raw information for your readme in a simple and intuitive format. You can also select from a number of optional elements to include in your README. This includes
* technologies used
* install type
* associated contributors
* and more...

1. Fill/Submit the form
2. Copy the output
3. Paste into your readme file
4. Enjoy a prettier readme
5. Look better for employers
6. Secure the bag

# WHERE I GOT YOU
* You can insert your own hyperlink for your hero-image or, at the bottom of this document are hyperlinks with a brief description.  All images are formatted to 900x450

* I wrote your information for linked-in under the contributors section. So if someone likes your work, they can get right to your linked-in and hang you a giant bag o' money.

* A note on the "About" section and the "Tags": Write a thorough about section and fill in the tags. **DO NOT** use spaces, instead use "-"

* Paste the "About" section in the Description area, and the "Tags" in the Topics section as shown below in the picture. This helps IMMENSELY in getting you found by interested parties.

* I tried to cover most of the project structures we have covered thus far, including optional sections on pagination and using Postman for api requests.

# WHERE I DON'T GOT YOU
* Members of the cohort who have dropped prior to my starting this project. I love all y'all, but I had to draw the line somewhere. 

* Specifications: I did not add logic for creating your spec table. If your project has specifications, select the checkbox for Specifications to add the Section Header for your Specs, and then use this great resource for making your spec table quickly.
