ABOUT


This project was made for the May 2020 Epicodus Cohort in an effort to make updating and editing the ~100+ repos we have made thus far. This application allows the user to input a projects details in a simple form, and output a well-structured and aesthetically pleasing README.md without getting bogged down in markdown syntax and worrying about uniformity across your repos. 

# WHERE I GOT YOU
* You can insert your own hyperlink for your hero-image or, at the bottom of this document are hyperlinks with a brief description.  All images are formatted to 900x450

* I hardcoded your photos and linked-in urls in the "Contributors" section, so if someone likes your work, they can get right to your linked-in.

* A note on the "About" section and the "Keywords": Write a thorough about section and fill in the keywords. Paste the "About" section in the Description area and the "Keywords" in the Topics section as shown below in the picture. This IMMENSELY helps fill out your repo and helps you get found MUCH easier.

# WHERE I DON'T GOT YOU
* Members of the cohort who have dropped prior to my starting this project. I love all y'all, but I had to draw the line somewhere. 

* Specifications: I did not add logic for creating your spec table. If your project has specifications, select the checkbox for Specifications to add the Section Header for your Specs, and then use this great resource for making your spec table quickly.
